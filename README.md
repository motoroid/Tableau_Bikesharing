# Bikesharing

## Purpose
### The purpose of this project is to help Kate convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. Although the data will be from August in NYC the analysis will show that based on New York that it will be a good pursuit.  

## Results
#### Note: Gitlab would not let me upload the CSV, and would error out that the file was too large, so I've included a screenshot.

### Deliverables include:
#### Tableau story (https://public.tableau.com/shared/T3XSW9RXQ?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) with the following 
##### a. Checkout time by Users and also by Gender:  This shows that Males are the dominant users and that all users use bikes in the first 30 min.

##### b. Heatmap of trips by weekday per hour:  This shows that during the week the heavest uses are during the rush hour commute and during the weekend it is from late morning to early evening.

##### c. Heatmap of trips by gender per day and per hour:  Analysis of these 2 visuals are that suscribers use higher than regular customers, and that the least busiest days are sunday, wednesday, and saturday.

##### d. Top places where bikes are picked up:  This may be irrelavant for Des Moines, but it does show that they are close to each other so a dense city might be a better place to use a bike sharing service.

##### e. Bikes due to repair:  This visual can help investors realize that bike repair is important and they should move around their inventory.

## Summary
#### I am not convinced that the bike sharing data from NYC can really correlate to the need in Des Moine.  NYC is a concentrated city where driving is difficult and things are close enough where it makes sense to ride a bike.  That being said I would suggest the following future visualizations:
##### 1.  Track how close the bikes are picked up to when they are dropped off.  
##### 2.  Understand more around age demographics and looked to see how they compare to Des Moine's general population.
