# Bikesharing

## Purpose
### The purpose of this project is to help Kate convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. Although the data will be from August in NYC the analysis will show that based on New York that it will be a good pursuit.  

## Results
#### Note: Gitlab would not let me upload the CSV, and would error out that the file was too large, so I've included a screenshot.

####  The way the search function work, is instead of putting in the and hitting a button, Dana would add what she was looking for in 1 or more of the boxes to filter 



## Summary
#### The one drawback to this design is you actually need to know the exact thing you are looking for and the capitalization.  If you don't choose an exact date the filter will not work.  Same with if you don't know the city or the country's 2 letter abbreviation in a spefic case.

#### For future development I would suggest adding a feature that would either suggest an input or allow for no case sensitivity.
